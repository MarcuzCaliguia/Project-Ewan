                Society is now better, significantly faster, and much more connected owing to Technology — 
                but none of this occurred spontaneously.
                <span class="read-more-text">
                We got here because of the creative ideas of professionals 
                and experts who channeled their enthusiasm of technological knowledge into the creation 
                of devices and computer programs that help us constantly in our lives. 
                Computer Science is an undergraduate course where students explore the design, creation, 
                and analysis of hardware and software used to tackle issues in a range of professional, 
                academic, and social settings.

            <p class="containermaintext">
                The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) is a four-year degree course that 
                encompasses computing theories, ideas, and foundational algorithms.
               
                <span class="read-more-text">
                    The curriculum equips students with the skills required to design and build algorithmically 
                    omplicated software as well as to bring new, efficient solutions to computational issues.
                    Although knowing how to program is essential to the study of computer science, it is only 
                    one element of the field. Computer scientists design and analyze algorithms to solve programs 
                    and study the performance
                    of computer hardware and software. The problems that computer scientists encounter range 
                    from the abstract-- determining what problems can be solved with computers and the 
                    complexity of the algorithms
                    that solve them – to the tangible – designing applications that perform well on handheld 
                    devices, that are easy to use, and that uphold security measures.

                While programming is a prerequisite for pursuing computer science, it is simply one aspect of the field. 
        When attending university, students can also acquire up and grasp the following expertise:
